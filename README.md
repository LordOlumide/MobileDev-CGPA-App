# mobile_dev_cgpa_app

My entry for the Mobile Dev Community CGPA App challenge.

## The App

The App's state is managed by Provider such that any changes are immediately reflected globally.
If a course is added, edited, or removed, the GPA, CGPA, course number, and units are automatically recalculated.
The local storage is done with hive.

## To Add:

- The data is not yet stored online.
- The user data is not yet stored separately online and offline. It will be implemented soon.
